# Pan-India-Analysis-of-Air-Quality
This project investigates the need for a large number of monitoring stations in a particular area. It analyzes whether there exists any significant difference in concentration of pollutants between selected monitoring stations in Mumbai, India. There are various factors that can affect air quality, including tree cover, population density, petrol price, temperature, humidity, wind pressure, air pressure, elevation, and coastal location. Understanding the relationships between these factors and air quality is imperative for developing effective plans to improve air quality. This project also applies a multinomial logistic regression model in order to predict the air quality class on the basis of the aforementioned factors.
